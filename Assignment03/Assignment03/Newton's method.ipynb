    "# Newton's method\n",
    "In this exercise you will use Newton's method for finding roots of the scalar function $f(x)$ to within a certain level of prescision (i.e., some small number $\\texttt{tol}$). Recall that with Newton's method, you make a guess for the root $x_0$, and then you draw a tangent line of $f(x)$ line at $x=x_0$. You then use the root of the tangent line as an $\\it{improved}$ guess of the root, which we will call $x_1$. We then draw another tangent line, now at the point $x_1$ and keep going $n$ times until your guess $x_{n}$ satifies some sort of stopping criteria. \n",
    "\n",
    "Newton's method reads $$x_{k+1}=x_{k}-\\frac{f(x_{k})}{f'(x_{k})},$$ which is the solution to the root of the tangent line of $f(x)$ at $x=x_k$. Note that this is best implemented using a while loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Stopping criteria**: Your stopping criteria should be something like $\\texttt{abs}(f(x_n))<\\texttt{tol}$ and/or $\\texttt{abs}(x_n-x_{n+1})<\\texttt{tol}$. In addition, it is sometimes wise to add another stopping criteria in case the algorithm $\\it does~not$ converge, for example \n",
